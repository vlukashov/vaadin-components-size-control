<!--
  This shell is to estimate the size of a Vaadin component for an app that uses
  the most common parts of Polymer 2.
  
  The parts of the Polymer library listed below are assumed to be already used on
  by the app and won't be counted into the size impact of the Vaadin component.

  Any other parts of the Polymer library (i.e. not listed here, nor a transitive
  dependency of something listed here) are assumed to be unused on the project.
  If the component depends on some of those, they will be counted into its size.
